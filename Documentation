                                               War card game.

 The game is developed following the rules defined here :
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)

 Program structure in simple words:

1. Prepare the deck for each player by generating 52 cards. The suits are ignored as they do not hold any significance
 in the game. There are 13 cards ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'K', 'Q', 'A') and 4 copies of each
 card in the deck.

2. The Deck is divided amongst two palyer by alternating the elements to simulate dealing of cards. Each Player gets a deck
 of 26 cards to play.

3. At every round of the game/battle, the top element of each Player's decks are compared to each other.

         The Player with higher card value gets both the cards.

         If the cards have equal value, then there is a war.
         During a war 3 cards from the both the Player's deck are removed and held in a list.
         The game continues with the next card. The player with higher card value at the draw, get all the cards which includes
         8 cards from the war_cards list and the two cards at the current round.

 The game is played until each player has atleast 4 cards. The minimum number of cards required to play is set as 4
 since 3 cards are faced down and 1 card is faced up during a war. This ensures game ends when one of the players
 have exhausted minimum number of cards needed to play the game.


 Corner cases addressed:

 1.Minimum number of cards needed to play the game.
 2.Two consecutive war situation.

 A utility method Status is provided to check the status of the cards at any point in the game.It shows the cards on the deck
 ,the cards in the war_cards list. The total number of cards at anytime in the game is given by number of cards in each player's
 deck and the cards on the table(war_cards, game_cards) which sums to 52.
